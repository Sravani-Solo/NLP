## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In the context of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, NLP plays a crucial role in various applications such as sentiment analysis, text generation, machine translation, and more.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how NLP techniques are used in ML and DL.

## Tokenization

**Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into individual tokens or words. It is often the first step in text preprocessing.

## Stemming

**Stemming** is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data by converting words with similar meanings into a common form.

## Stopwords

**Stopwords** are common words like "and," "the," and "is" that are often removed from text data during preprocessing to improve the efficiency of NLP algorithms.

## Lemmatization

**Lemmatization** is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, known as lemmas. It is a more advanced technique compared to stemming as it considers the context of the word.

## Word2Vec

**Word2Vec** is a popular word embedding technique that represents words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. It captures semantic relationships between words and is used in various NLP tasks.

## Average Word2Vec

**Average Word2Vec** computes the average vector representation of words in a text document. It is often used as a simple yet effective way to represent entire documents.

## Word Embeddings

**Word embeddings** are vector representations of words, and they are fundamental to many NLP tasks. They capture semantic and syntactic information about words, making them essential for ML and DL models.

## Types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a class of neural networks that are widely used in NLP tasks. They include Vanilla RNNs, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), among others, each with its unique applications.
